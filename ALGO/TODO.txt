COMBINATORICS

generate all permutations
generate all subsets
generate all n-tuples
generate all multisets

generate all subsets of submask

return next/previous (combinatorial structure of some kind)
- permutation, subset, n-tuple, partition, k-partition, k-subset, etc

evaluate binomial
evaluate multinomial

random from gaussian distribution (box muller)
draw from other distributions

SEARCH

STRING

aho-corasick
given a string, calculate transition table[a][b]:
  if we have matched to pos a and see char b, transition to position in table

OTHER

take old c routines and fix them
