COMBINATORICS

generate all permutations
generate all subsets
generate all n-tuples
generate all multisets

generate all subsets of submask
generate all k-element subsets (snoob)

return next/previous (combinatorial structure of some kind)
- permutation, subset, n-tuple, partition, k-partition, k-subset, etc

evaluate binomial
evaluate multinomial

lucas' theorem

rank/unrank (combinatorial structure)
- see next/previous

COMPUTATIONAL-GEOMETRY

ccw
line-line intersection
line-circle intersection
polegon-polygon intersection
convex hull (both with and without collinear points)
point in polygon
point in triangle (special case of above)
distance from point to line, line segment, circle, polygon etc
projection of point to line (2d), plane (3d)

circle geometry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_segment

DATA STRUCTURE

binomial heap
fibonacci heap
red-black tree (looks rather complicated to implement)
avl tree
splay tree
aa tree
scapegoat tree
treap
b-tree?

some kind of balanced tree with the following operations:
- insert element
- delete element
- find K-th element
^ this one is important!

GRAPH

bellman-ford
maxflow with edge lists, memory usage O(E), edge lookup time O(E)
mincost maxflow
bipartite matching with capacity >1 between each pair
in an undirected graph, find articulation points in connected component
 (node such that if removed, the component is no longer connected)
  check https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Articulation_point
in an undirected graph, find bridge in connected component (edge such
  that if removed, the component is no longer connected)
  check https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bridge_%28graph_theory%29
tarjan's scc
special maxflow code for the "tripartite matching in graph" problem: given
  nodes X,Y,Z such that all edges are from X to Y or Y to Z, find a max
  matching. not to be confused with the NP-complete problem.
