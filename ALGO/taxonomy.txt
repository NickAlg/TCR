my attempt at classifying algorithms and domains

graph theory
 network flow
  max flow
   minimum cut
   mincost maxflow
   maximum cardinality matching in bipartite graph
    max/min weight matching in bipartite graph (aka hungarian algorithm)
    minimum vertex cover in bipartite graph (aka könig's theorem)
   maximum matching in "tripartite graph"
 shortest path
  one-to-all shortest-path
   one-to-all shortest-path, no negative costs (dijkstra)
    one-to-all shortest-path, costs on nodes, no negative costs
   one-to-all shortest-path, negative costs
  all-pairs shortest path (floyd-warshall)
 graph search
  uninformed search
   breadth-first search
    modified breadth-first search, costs can be 0 or 1
   depth-first search
   flood fill
  bidirectional search
  informed search (A*)
 strongly connected components
 topological sort
 minimum spanning tree (prim, kruskal)
  minimum arborescence
 steiner tree
  discrete steiner tree
 eulerian path/cycle
 find articulation point in graph
 find bridge in graph
 planarity
 hamilton path/cycle
  longest simple path in general graph
 maximum matching in general graph (edmond's blossom algorithm)
