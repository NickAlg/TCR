/* TODO implement an efficient algorithm for finding a
   hamiltonian cycle.
   support:
   - find one/all hamiltonian cycles
   - count the number of hamiltonian cycles
   maybe let the user do the necessary transformation in order to find
   hamiltonian paths
*/

/* TODO implement from the paper
   "a search procedure for hamilton paths and circuits"
   by frank rubin (1973)
   this algorithm is pretty easy to understand, and it seems to be
   efficient even for large-ish n (up to 1000)
*/

/* TODO i have another ton of papers on the subject. check these and
   consider to implement a fancier variant */

/* TODO test on:
   uva 775
   hacker.org "oneofus"
