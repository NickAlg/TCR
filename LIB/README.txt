here be single (and single-ish) file programs made by other people. none
of these should require installation.

works in mingw64:

FFTW
GMP (c++ example doesn't work on w64, missing header)
INTRINSICS
OPENMP
PTHREAD
SDL
SDLMIXER (64-bit version doesn't support mod, no mikmod)
SDLNET (it seems connection doesn't happen most of the time, maybe it's just a bad example program)
