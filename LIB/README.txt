here be single (and single-ish) file programs using third-party libraries.
none of these should require installation (except for the library).

most of these work on my mingw64 install, except:
GMP (c++ example, but i don't care about c++ anyway)
SDLMIXER (not mod support due to missing 64-bit mikmod, which is of no great
          consequence as SDL2MIXER has mod support)
