===============

My personal collection of algorithms implemented in C for use in programming
competitions.

These routines can be used for anything by anyone, with the following
restriction:

Do not use these routines on TopCoder! (Cannot use other people's code at that
site.)

Also, this is my personal code snippet collection and there will never be other
committers but myself. I'll happily take suggestions, though.

subdirectories:

ALGO - implementations of algorithms
ALGO-LATEX - documents
API - example code for built-in libraries
ASM - assembly stuff
CRYPTO - cryptographic routines
LIB - example code for external libraries
nehe - nehe tutorial (nb, bmp files are not in repo)
routines-JAVA - messy collection of routines in java
routines-c++ - messy collection of routines in c++
routines-c - messy collection of routines in c
routines-clisp - messy collection of routines in common lisp (just one routine, actually)
