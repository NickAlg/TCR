===============

My personal collection of algorithms implemented in C for use in programming
competitions.

These routines can be used for anything by anyone, with the following
restriction:

Do not use these routines on TopCoder! (Cannot use other people's code at that
site.)

Also, this is my personal code snippet collection and there will never be other
committers but myself. I'll happily take suggestions, though.
